# Visual Pathfinder: Interactive Graph Traversal

http://visualpathfinder.rf.gd

Pathfinder is a visualization programs that allows users to see 2d mazes and maze solution algorithms generate in real time. The program allows users to resize the grid, change speeds at which maze generation and solving animations occurs, generate four different maze types, and use five unique algorithms to traverse the grid. Users can also easily reposition the start and end nodes. Path and full graph clearing functions are built in and easily accessible.
